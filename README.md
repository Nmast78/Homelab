# Nick's Homelab
What is a homelab?

A homelab is a laboratory at home where you can self-host, experiment with new technologies, develop your skills, and lots else. 

## Overview
This is the repository I developed during summer 2025. The homelab consists of the following hardware:
1. Raspberry Pi 4B
2. Raspberry Pi 3B
3. Levono ThinkPad T560
4. TPLink TL-SF1005P Unmanaged Switch

As you can see, it does not consist of much hardwareðŸ˜‚. However, you might be suprised how much you can do and learn on such limited hardware.

Below is the diagram of my homelab, as well as some of the programs and containers that are running on each device.
