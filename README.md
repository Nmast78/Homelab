# Nick's Homelab
What is a homelab?

A homelab is a laboratory at home where you can self-host, experiment with new technologies, develop your skills, and lots else. 

## Overview
This is the repository I developed during summer 2025. The homelab consists of the following hardware:
1. Raspberry Pi 4B
2. Raspberry Pi 3B
3. Levono ThinkPad T560
4. TPLink TL-SF1005P Unmanaged Switch

As you can see, it does not consist of much hardwareðŸ˜‚. However, you might be suprised how much you can do and learn on such limited hardware.
